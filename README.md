# Hi there! I'm heiu👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a mix of personal projects and open-source contributions. I like creating things that are both boring and useless, combining entertainment and productivity in unique ways✌️✌️.

## 🔧 Projects

- **stonake**: A seamless combination of precise time tracking and nostalgic snake gameplay. Perfect for those who enjoy both productivity and entertainment in one app.
- **QRaster**: Help you "scan" physical QR code without a camera.
- **Other cool stuff**: Stay tuned for more awesome projects as I continue building and experimenting.
- If you're wondering whether I'll take coding seriously in the future, the answer is yes. I have plenty of ideas and will definitely work on some really useful stuff in the near future!
